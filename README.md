## Vision Statement

For a consumer of media who needs to keep track of the individual status of consumption for each of their media artifacts, Get Your Shit Together keeps track of the status of their consumption for each media artifact and recommends new media artifacts based on consumption. Unlike MyAnimeList, Cinetrak, and Backloggery which can only keep track of and recommend new media artifacts in a single medium, our product can keep track of and recommend across mediums.
