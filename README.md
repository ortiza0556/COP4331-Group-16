## Definitions

Backlog: An organized list of unfinished media that the user has a desire to consume and finish at some point in time.

## Vision Statement

For a consumer of media who needs to keep track of the individual status of consumption for each of their TV Shows, animes, movies, or video games, Get Your Shit Together keeps track of how far they have completed each TV Show, anime, movie, or video game and recommends new TV Shows, animes, movies, or video games based on consumption history. Unlike MyAnimeList, Cinetrak, and Backloggery which can only keep track of and recommend new movies, TV shows, anime, and video games in their medium, our product can keep track of and recommend across mediums by finding patterns in genre.
